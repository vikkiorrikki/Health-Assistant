# Health-Assistant

Simple Health Assistant app for managing your visits to different categories of doctors.

First tab - Calendar with Events to Docotors (that user created in 2nd tab).
Second tab - List of categories of doctors. Inside each category user can create own set of Events.
Third tab - Map with clinics (now clinics show for Saint Petersburg).
